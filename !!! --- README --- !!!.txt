Hello.

This setup allows you to compile all CI models at once. You can do that by compiling the entire folder (and subfolders if you want) using crowbar.
Remember the Uncommon infected need to look like uncommons. Else it'll be annoying to play.
Uncommons are: Riot, Ceda, Clown, Roadcrew/male_baggagehandler02, Mudman, Fallen Survivor/Parachutist, Jimmy

Table of contents:

Folders: 
Custom_Model_Files_Here	-	Contains the models you want to compile
Gib_Body_Wounds			-	Contains body wound models, like decapitated neck and lacerated body.
Gib_Limbs				-	Contains head, arm, leg and torso gibs that fall when the CI explodes or gets sliced up.
QCI						-	Contains QCI files. The Shared_All.qci contians info that ALL commons will have. Edit it to get a cdmaterials for all infected

Files:
!!_Ceda_Faceplate.qc            -	Face plate for the CEDA uncommon. Both L4D1 and L4D2 Ceda agents.
!!_Fallen_Survivor_Pocket0x.qc	-	Pockets that the fallen survivor would wear Should align with their attachment spots if used. Else make them invisible.
!!_Riotcot_Faceplate.qc			-	Face plate for the Riot Infected. Both L4D1 and L4D2 riot cops
All qc files are named after the model they replace ingame.
